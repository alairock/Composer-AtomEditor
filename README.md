#Looking for maintainer
I don't have time for this project anymore. This has the fancy 'composer' namespace on atom.io so I would relinquish that to you, so long as you promise to take care of it :) Message me if you are interested.


# Composer for Atom Editor

This is the Composer runner for the Atom Editor. Run composer commands in real time inside the atom editor!
